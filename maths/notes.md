When we divide in a program the time complexity will be logirithmic base divisor

lets suppose if in our program we are dividing the no. n / 10

then O(log10(n)) is the time complexity 

same like this we the no. is being divided by n/2 or n/5 or n/20 then it will be O(log2(n)), O(log5(n)), O(log20(n)).
